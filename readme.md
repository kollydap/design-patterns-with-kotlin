# Kotlin Design Patterns

Welcome to my **Kotlin Design Patterns** repository! 🚀 This project showcases various design patterns implemented in Kotlin, providing practical examples and real-world use cases.

## 📌 About
Design patterns are best practices used to solve common software design problems. This repository serves as a reference for learning and applying design patterns in Kotlin, helping to write clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

## 🏗 Patterns Implemented
The repository includes examples of the following design patterns:

### **Creational Patterns** 🏭
- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Factory Method
- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Prototype

### **Structural Patterns** 🏗
- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Facade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Proxy

### **Behavioral Patterns** 🤖
- [ ] Chain of Responsibility
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Template Method
- [ ] Visitor

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kollydap/design-patterns-with-kotlin.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your favorite Kotlin IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Navigate to the pattern you want to explore.
4. Run the Kotlin files to see the patterns in action.
